# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
In this project I had to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. I had to make the new code run successful and the VBA script run faster.

### Purpose
The main purpose of the challenge to learn how to refactor the solution code to loop through all the data one time. Determine if the new code runs faster.

## Results

-What stock perform better by years?
By analyzing the outcomes we see after running the code we can tell that stock market was better in 2017. All stocks except the TERP grew up. By the end of 2018 most of the stocks dropped in price. The only 2 stocks that were continue growing were RUN and ENPH. 
-What script ran faster the original or the refactored? 
The refactored script helped us to analyze all the data and ran faster with results of 0.125 seconds for 2017 and 0.0703125 seconds for 2018 data.

##Summary
- What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
Refactoring makes software easier to understand, helps the program run faster and find bugs. Sometimes refactoring code could introduce new errors and bugs.

- How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
Refactoring script can improve the results of running it compare to the original or can be difficult especialy if the person who does that is not the same person as original designer.
